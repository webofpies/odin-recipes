        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Unless you live in the Northeast, beef "tips" are not something you see on menus very often.</p>
        <p>That's a shame, since they are one of the great, meaty comfort foods of all time.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ pounds beef round steak</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice beef into 3/4-inch strips.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat until shimmering. Transfer in beef, arranging in a single layer.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium and add tomato paste, garlic, and butter.</li>
            <li>Stir in broth. Raise heat to high and bring to a simmer. Reduce to low, cover, and cook until beef is starting to get tender, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). </li>
            <li>Uncover, turn heat to medium, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened, and the meat is tender, about 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
