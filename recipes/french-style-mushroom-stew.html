        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Mushrooms simmered with onions, wine, and carrots make for a rich, French-style stew. Serve with egg noodles, polenta, or mashed potatoes.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>16 ounces button mushrooms, chopped</li>
            <li>8 ounces cremini mushrooms, chopped</li>
            <li>8 ounces shiitake mushrooms, chopped</li>
            <li>8 ounces oyster mushrooms, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cups roughly chopped onion</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided, or to taste</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 large leek, white and light green parts only, diced</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine all four mushroom types in a large bowl with onions; toss gently to mix.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a very large pot over medium-high heat. Cover the bottom of the pot with one layer of the mushroom-onion mixture. Cook, without moving them around too much, until they begin to brown and caramelize on one side, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Season mushroom-onion mixture with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and 1 tablespoon oil to the pot. Add leek and carrots and saute until leeks turn a light golden color and start to soften, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in tomato paste; cook for 1 minute. Add flour; cook and stir for 1 more minute.</li>
            <li>Add wine, vegetable broth, tamari, cayenne, thyme, and bay leaves, and scrape up the brown bits at the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. Carefully add the mushroom-onion mixture. Bring to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to low and simmer, partly covered, until carrots and onions are tender and sauce has thickened, 30 to 40 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
